# Four_Pillar_Alert_System
This is the project work titled **‘Four Pillar Alert System’** by **‘Ananth Jeeth, Vishwa Teja, Harini Siddharth and Pavan Raju’** 
under the mentorship of **‘P. Aarushraj, K. Bharath Chandra’** and is a record of the project work carried out by them during the year 2022-2023 as part of INDUCTION

## THE PROBLEM
Many accidents occur at sharp turns, especially on narrow roads for example ghat roads or hilly areas, Traffic Police intervention, convex mirror installation, and other techniques, though helpful in these situations are not very efficient in preventing accidents. So, if you see there will be only one convex mirror placed at the turning but the disadvantage of this convex mirror is until the vehicle comes closer to the mirror it can't see the other side. The drivers are not alert of the opposite vehicles. It becomes difficult to manage vehicles in severe and extreme conditions like rainfall, snow, foggy weather and a high number of sharp curves and U-turns. 
Also in hilly areas due to the narrow roads, it will be difficult for two vehicles to pass in opposite directions so even to reduce this problem we need to develop a system that can manage the flow of vehicles smoothly on narrow roads.

## Abstract
A four-pillar vehicle alert system, this system is helpful to reduce accidents at Blind curves and hair-pin bend roads. When a vehicle is detected on one side of the road Alert signal will be provided and vehicle will be stopped on the other side of the road to prevent road accidents and traffic congestion at blind curves.

## WORKING
The working of the Four Pillar system (Alert system) is simple. When a vehicle is detected using an IR sensor either downhill or uphill, then an alert signal is displayed on the other side of the hill, LED on the opposite side turns to RED and the gate is closed until the same vehicle is detected on the other side, at that time the LED turns to Green and gate opens.

## Future Enhancements
This data can be used for enhanced traffic management, road use, and traffic flow on single-line tunnels and restricted areas by employing Artificial Intelligence and machine learning tools. This alert system can also be used for challan systems. We can also use this project for commercial purposes like traffic control in malls and buildings with multi-storey parking systems.
