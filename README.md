# Four_Pillar_Alert_System
This is the project work titled **‘Four Pillar Alert System’** by ‘Ananth Jeeth, Vishwa Teja, Harini Siddharth, Pavan Raju’ 
under the mentorship of ‘P. Aarushraj, K. Bharath Chandra’ and is a record of the project work carried out by them during the year 2022-2023 as part of INDUCTION


## THE PROBLEM
There are many accidents occurring at sharp turns especially at narrow roads for example at ghat roads or hilly areas, Traffic Police intervention, convex mirrors installation, and other techniques, though helpful in these situations but they are not much efficient in preventing accidents. So, if you see there will be only one convex mirror place at the turning but the disadvantage of this convex mirror is until the vehicle come closer to the mirror they can't see other side. The drivers are not alert of the opposite vehicles. It become difficult to manage vehicles in severe and extreme conditions like rainfall, snow, foggy weather and high number of sharp curves and U-turns. 
Also at hilly areas due to narrow road it will get difficult for two vehicles to pass in opposite directions so even to reduce this problem we need to develop a system that can manage the flow of vehicles smoothly at narrows roads.
